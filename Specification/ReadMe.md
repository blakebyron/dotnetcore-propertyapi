# Property Api Specification

The Api will be documentation using using verion 3 of the [OpenApi Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/)

## Prerequisites

To view the specification you can use any text editor.

The combination of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and the [Swagger Viewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Arjun.swagger-viewer) extension works well.

An alternative, is to use the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io) which is available online or the code can be downloded in full from the [Swagger-editor](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor) repo on github.

## Versions

There are two versions of the specification for this Api

### Develop

The [develop](DevelopOpenApiSpec.yaml) version is a handwritten version of the specification and will be used to help guide the build the application

### Master

The master version is the output from the implemented application.

There may be some minor differences between the two. But the master always takes precedent.
